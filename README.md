# Cryptocurrency
### THIS PROJECT WAS MAINLY HEADED BY AN INDIVIDUAL MY FREINDS AND I ARE NO LONGER ASSOCIATED WITH. WHILE I AM KEEPING THIS CODE PUBLIC AS A RECORD, I AM NOT ENDORSING THE PROJECT'S CREATOR AND WILL NOT BE CONTINUING DEVELOPMENT
An experimental cryptocurrency project made in an attempt to solve the blockchain scalability problem.

Name will be decided once the project has been developed far enough to merit one.

The secondary goal of this project is learning and thus everything will be written from scratch (hashing algorithms, signature schemes, etc). These implementations may be sub-optimal in terms of speed, readability, and security. Contributions to improve this code are welcome.

This project currently features:
* SHA256 and SHA512 hashing
* Unit testing framework
* Arbitrary size BigInt supporting the four basic operations, exponents, and negative numbers
